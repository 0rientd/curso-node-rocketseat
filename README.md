# Node.js Fundamentals Journey

This repository documents my journey through the fundamentals of Node.js, with practical examples and hands-on projects. Each directory inside `aulas` represents a lesson, showcasing a specific concept or feature of the Node.js ecosystem.

## üöÄ What's Inside?

This project is a collection of simple Node.js applications, each demonstrating a core concept. Here's a breakdown of what you'll find in each lesson:

*   **01-fundamentos-node-js:** The very basics. Learn how to create a simple HTTP server from scratch using the `http` module.
*   **02-fundamentos-node-js:** Building a basic API. This lesson introduces request and response handling, routing, and the use of JSON.
*   **03-fundamentos-node-js:** Diving into Streams. Explore the power of streams for handling data efficiently. This lesson covers `Readable`, `Writable`, and `Transform` streams, as well as the concept of `Buffers`.
*   **04-fundamentos-node-js:** Data persistence. Learn how to work with a file-based database to store and retrieve data.
*   **05-fundamentos-node-js:** Building a complete RESTful API. This lesson brings everything together, with a focus on creating a well-structured API with routes, middlewares, and a database module. It also covers advanced routing with URL params and query strings.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

You can explore each lesson individually. To run the code:

1.  Navigate to the desired lesson's directory (e.g., `cd aulas/01-fundamentos-node-js`).
2.  Install the dependencies: `npm install`.
3.  Run the server: `npm run dev`.
